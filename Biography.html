	<p> Growing up my love for numbers had no bound. Because of that I decided to study accounting in the university, which I graduated with BSc. in Accounting from Micheal University of Agriculture. After NYSC, I had the opportunity to teache Mathematics to JSS 1-3 classes and i fell in love with imparting to younger genration, especailly to the girl child that had slow learning process.</p>
	<p> This made to push in getting a Postgraduate Diploma in Education so as to give my a platform to impart more to the children left in my care.</p> 
	<p> I have still not forget the love for calculation, this made me to be in pursuit in Data Analytics Course.</p>
	<p>	My dream is to create a condusive environment for molested children, give them voice through education and enhance them</p>
